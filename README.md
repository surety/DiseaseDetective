# DiseaseDetective
Disease Detectives uses machine learning algorithm 'MobileNet' in order to accuratly diagnose skin diseases.
This current demo is trained to classify a small data-set of diseases but future plans are:
	Adding more accessible features
	Adding 'get help' feature to show close locations to doctors, creams, etc
	Training in a much larger dataset
	Web / Mobile applications
